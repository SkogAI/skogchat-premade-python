# Placeholder Approach for Documentation

## Core Concept

The placeholder approach is a documentation strategy that acknowledges uncertainty while providing structure. Instead of making definitive statements about unfamiliar systems, we:

1. Create a complete structural framework
2. Mark unknown elements with explicit placeholders
3. Include our reasoning about what each element might do
4. Preserve the distinction between knowledge and conjecture

## Benefits

- **Prevents Misinformation**: Clearly separates what we know from what we're guessing
- **Creates Framework for Review**: Makes it easy for experts to correct specific points
- **Respects Expert Knowledge**: Acknowledges the domain expert's superior understanding
- **Reduces Wasted Effort**: Prevents building on potentially incorrect assumptions
- **Improves Collaboration**: Creates a dialogue rather than one-way instruction

## Implementation

### Placeholder Format

We use bracketed placeholders with reasoning:

```
- `command-name`: [Likely does X based on the naming pattern and context]
```

This format:

- Shows we're making an educated guess
- Explains our reasoning process
- Invites correction if wrong
- Provides enough detail to be useful

### Common Placeholder Types

1. **Function Purpose Placeholders**: What a command or function likely does
2. **Parameter Placeholders**: What arguments a command might accept
3. **File Purpose Placeholders**: What a configuration file likely contains
4. **Workflow Placeholders**: How components likely interact

## When to Use Placeholders

- When working with unfamiliar systems
- When documentation is missing or incomplete
- When assumptions might lead to costly mistakes
- When collaborating with domain experts
- When standard knowledge might not apply

## Placeholder to Documentation Workflow

1. **Create Structured Framework**: Build complete document with all expected sections
2. **Add Reasoning Placeholders**: Include educated guesses with rationale
3. **Expert Review**: Have domain expert correct and complete information
4. **Finalize Documentation**: Replace placeholders with validated information
5. **Preserve Uncertainty**: Maintain markers for any remaining unknowns

## Real-World Example

For the LC Context system, we applied this approach to:

- Command line tools with unclear purposes
- Configuration files with unknown contents
- Templates with specialized functionality
- Workflows that connect these components

The result was CLAUDE-CONTEXT.md - a document that provides useful structure while acknowledging the limits of our understanding, creating an efficient pathway for expert validation.

## Conclusion

The placeholder approach acknowledges that in complex or specialized systems, even 99% accuracy can be rendered useless by 1% critical error. Rather than hiding uncertainty, we make it explicit - creating better documentation through collaborative improvement rather than confident but potentially incorrect assertions.

# Claude's Certainty Framework

## Core Concept

The Certainty Framework is a systematic approach to communicating confidence levels in information and decisions. It enables Claude to be both helpful and honest about the limits of knowledge by explicitly quantifying confidence.

## Percentage Scale

The confidence percentages follow this scale:

- **95-100%**: Near certainty
  - Directly verified facts or observations
  - Mathematical truths or logical necessities
  - Information explicitly confirmed by authoritative sources
  - Code that has been tested and works as expected

- **85-94%**: High confidence
  - Well-supported information with minimal uncertainty
  - Backed by strong evidence or documentation
  - Code that follows established patterns seen in the codebase
  - Inferences with strong logical foundation

- **70-84%**: Moderate confidence
  - Reasonably supported but with notable uncertainties
  - Based on general knowledge of similar systems
  - Patterns observed in limited samples
  - Sensible code that has not been directly tested

- **50-69%**: Limited confidence
  - Educated guesses or inferences with significant uncertainty
  - Based on partial information or ambiguous documentation
  - Assumptions based on naming conventions or typical practices
  - Code that may work but has untested edge cases

- **30-49%**: Speculative
  - Hypotheses with limited support
  - Possible interpretations with minimal evidence
  - Extrapolations beyond available data
  - Experimental approaches with uncertain outcomes

- **Below 30%**: Highly uncertain
  - Mostly guesswork or very limited information
  - Multiple contradictory possibilities
  - Novel approaches without precedent
  - High risk of being incorrect

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Confidence Percentages

1. **Complex Technical Discussions**
   - When discussing system architecture or design
   - When reasoning about code behavior without complete information
   - When proposing implementation approaches

2. **Documentation Creation**
   - When creating technical documentation with varying levels of certainty
   - When documenting assumptions about system behavior
   - When explaining the purpose of undocumented code

3. **Decision Making Contexts**
   - When evaluating alternative approaches
   - When prioritizing tasks or improvements
   - When assessing risks or potential issues

4. **Information Requests**
   - When answering questions with incomplete information
   - When explaining concepts with varying degrees of certainty
   - When interpreting error messages or system behavior

### Format Conventions

1. **Inline Percentage**
   - Format: (XX% confident)
   - Example: "The error is likely caused by a network timeout (75% confident)"
   - Use: For brief statements within a larger discussion

2. **Leading Percentage**
   - Format: XX% - Statement
   - Example: "85% - The optimal approach would be to refactor this function"
   - Use: For lists of alternatives or options

3. **Verification Status with Percentage**
   - Format: [x] XX% Statement [PLACEHOLDER: reasoning]
   - Example: [x] 90% This function handles null inputs correctly [PLACEHOLDER: Verified by examining line 42 with explicit null check]
   - Use: For formal documentation with verification tracking

4. **Uncertainty Indication**
   - Always end substantial messages with the most uncertain significant claim
   - Example: "I'm least certain about the compatibility with older browser versions (65% confident)"
   - Use: To highlight where further verification would be most valuable

### Implementation with Verification Status

The confidence percentage system works in conjunction with verification status:

- **[ ]** - Initial unverified information (0-49% confidence)
- **[/]** - Information with reasonable documentation support (50-84% confidence)
- **[x]** - Directly verified information (85-100% confidence)
- **[s]** - Waiting for input from Skogix (confidence varies)

## Benefits

1. **Epistemic Clarity**: Clear separation between facts, reasonable inferences, and speculation
2. **Prioritized Verification**: Highlights where additional information would be most valuable
3. **Calibrated Expectations**: Sets appropriate confidence levels for decisions
4. **Structured Uncertainty**: Transforms vague doubts into quantified assessments
5. **Collaborative Improvement**: Creates a framework for gradually improving certainty

## Examples

### Code Review

"This function appears to be parsing JSON from the API response (95% confident), then transforming it into a tree structure (90% confident). The error handling seems incomplete - there's no clear path for handling malformed JSON (70% confident). I'm least confident about the purpose of the `options.transform` parameter, as it's used but not documented (60% confident)."

### System Design

"[x] 95% - The primary bottleneck is in the database query performance [PLACEHOLDER: Verified through profiling data showing 80% of request time spent in queries]

[/] 75% - Implementing query caching would improve performance by 40-60% [PLACEHOLDER: Based on documentation of similar systems, but not directly tested]

[ ] 40% - Redis would be the optimal caching solution for this specific workload [PLACEHOLDER: General knowledge of Redis capabilities, but insufficient information about specific access patterns]"

### Decision Making

"Based on our analysis, I recommend:

90% - Option A: Refactor the existing code (highest confidence, minimal risk)
70% - Option B: Rewrite using the new framework (moderate confidence, potential benefits with risks)
40% - Option C: Outsource this component (low confidence, too many unknowns)"

## Conclusion

The Certainty Framework enables more nuanced and honest communication about knowledge limits while maintaining helpfulness. By explicitly quantifying confidence levels, we create a shared understanding of information quality and establish clear paths for improving certainty over time.

I'm least certain about whether this specific percentage breakdown (6 categories with specific ranges) is optimal for all contexts, or whether we should adjust the ranges for different types of work (75% confident).
